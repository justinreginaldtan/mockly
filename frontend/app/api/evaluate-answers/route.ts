/*
 * Integration Guide:
 *
 * 1. Install Gemini SDK: npm install @google/generative-ai
 *
 * 2. Set up environment variable: GEMINI_API_KEY
 *
 * 3. Example implementation:
 *
 * import { GoogleGenerativeAI } from "@google/generative-ai";
 *
 * const genAI = new GoogleGenerativeAI(process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY);
 * const model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: "gemini-pro" });
 *
 * const prompt = `Evaluate these interview responses against the job description.
 * Provide detailed analysis of JD coverage, evidence snippets, and improvement suggestions.
 *
 * Job Description: ${jobDescription}
 * Resume: ${resumeText}
 *
 * Interview Responses:
 * ${answers.map((a, i) => `Q${i+1}: ${a.question}\nA${i+1}: ${a.text}`).join('\n\n')}
 *
 * Return a structured JSON evaluation with:
 * - jdCoverage (hit/partial/miss percentages)
 * - evidenceSnippets (quotes matching JD requirements)
 * - upgradeLines (specific improvement suggestions)
 * - weakAreas (topics needing more practice)
 * - overallScore (0-100)`;
 *
 * const result = await model.generateContent(prompt);
 * const evaluation = JSON.parse(result.response.text());
